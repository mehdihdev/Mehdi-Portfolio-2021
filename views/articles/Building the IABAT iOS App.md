description: "The IABAT iOS App is one of my first Projects that was going to be public and be used by at least hundreds of people. It was also the first app that I made in Swift."

You Can find the source Code Here : <https://github.com/mehdihdev/IABAT>

The IABAT App uses these Libraries :

-   Adhan Swift : <https://github.com/batoulapps/adhan-swift>

-   Google Fonts (Fonts Used: Raleway, Poppins, Monsterrat) : [https://fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/)

-   Apple's "CoreLocation" Library

-   Firebase Auth and Analytics : [https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/)

-   Admob : <https://admob.google.com/>

... And that's about It, I tried to stay as First Party as possible, so there was less room for failure. But Apple doesn't really do everything. The App took about 8 months from start to finish, which sounds like a lot, but This was my first app, and I also had School alongside this, in the last three months was where I really started to work on the App.
